## Install Git

## Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
When you install a Gatsby “starter” site, Gatsby uses Git behind the scenes to download and install the required files for your starter. You will need to have Git installed to set up your first Gatsby site.
