1. ## Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

2. ## Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

## Editing the content

The content of the page is managed by .mdx files inside the theme's sections folder. You can edit the files by shadowing them in your site.

These files are available: intro.mdx, projects.mdx, about.mdx, contact.mdx

See the example that shadows via src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/sections/intro.mdx:

## Changing content

The content of this project is defined in four `.mdx` files inside the theme's `sections` folder. You can override the files `intro.mdx`, `projects.mdx`, `about.mdx` and `contact.mdx`. This starter has overriden the `intro.mdx` file as an example. Place the other files in the same `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/sections/` folder.
