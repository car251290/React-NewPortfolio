## About
3 years working as a Software Developer building Web applications using JavaScript. I love creating solutions to problems taking deep dives into how/why things work, and continuously improving my skill as a developer. Building my expertise in multiple programming languages, platforms, and tools to provide quality product functionality and user experiences. Also, a good communicator who can effectively work with users, technical teams, and senior developers.

 My education and experience in Mechatronics have provided me with a strong foundation in solving complex problems in the Front-End and Back-End.
